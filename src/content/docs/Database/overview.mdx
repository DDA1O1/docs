## What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data, making it accessible for various applications and users.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Data Organization:** Structured in tables, documents, or key-value pairs
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures accuracy and consistency of data
- **Concurrency Control:** Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously
- **Security:** Provides access control and data protection

## Types of Databases

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)
- Store data in tables with rows and columns
- Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

### 2. NoSQL Databases
- Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data
- Flexible schema design
- Types:
  - Document-oriented (MongoDB)
  - Key-value stores (Redis)
  - Wide-column stores (Cassandra)
  - Graph databases (Neo4j)

### 3. In-Memory Databases
- Store data in main memory for faster access
- Ideal for real-time applications
- Examples: Redis, Memcached

### 4. Time Series Databases
- Optimized for time-stamped data
- Used for IoT, financial data, and monitoring systems
- Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

### 5. Cloud Databases
- Hosted on cloud platforms
- Scalable and managed services
- Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Firestore
