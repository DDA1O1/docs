title: Why These Docs Exist
description: Understanding the purpose and how to approach this guide.

- Anything can be *`Learned`* as long as you have well written documentation for it.

<Aside type="note" title="Seriously Important">
  **I cannot emphasize enough the importance of having well-written documentation.**
</Aside>

## The Reality of Docs

- Although the majority of Documentations were written by the developers themselves cause they know what they are talking about... they were not necessarily trained in how to write well.
- So, they often expect you to be well-versed with the prerequisites *before* reading their documentation.

## Our Goal Here

We want these docs to be different. Here's the plan:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="A Reliable Reference">
    Create documentation you can actually rely on - don't just depend on trying to remember everything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid 'Tutorial Hell'">
    Focus on **building** things, not just watching or reading endless tutorials without applying the knowledge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Take Action">
    Get you moving forward instead of getting stuck forever in the research phase.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Before You Start

<Aside type="tip" title="Keep This in Mind">
*   No single resource is going to teach you absolutely everything.
*   This guide is here to give you the foundational knowledge to actually get started.
*   Do not expect that you will become an expert just by reading this guide (or any guide, really).
*   It can take a *long* time, maybe even a decade, to truly master any subject. Patience and practice are key.
