## Raw Server

Raw servers refer to traditional physical machines running a single operating system directly on hardware. While powerful, they have significant limitations:

- **Resource Underutilization**: Most applications use only a fraction of server capacity
- **Difficult Scaling**: Adding capacity requires new physical hardware
- **Long Provisioning Time**: Setting up new servers takes days or weeks
- **High Maintenance Costs**: Each server needs physical space, power, cooling
- **Limited Isolation**: Applications on the same server can interfere with each other

## Hypervisors: The First Solution

These limitations led to the development of hypervisors in the early 2000s:

- **Type 1 (Bare Metal)**: Run directly on hardware (VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V)
- **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Run on a host OS (VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

Hypervisors enabled virtual machines (VMs) that:
- Improved resource utilization through consolidation
- Provided better isolation between workloads
- Enabled faster provisioning compared to physical servers

However, VMs still had drawbacks:
- Each VM required a full OS installation
- Significant resource overhead
- Limited portability between different environments

## Docker: The Container Revolution

Docker emerged in 2013 to address VM limitations by using container technology:

- **Shared Kernel**: Containers share the host OS kernel, eliminating OS duplication
- **Lightweight**: Start in seconds instead of minutes, use minimal resources
- **Portable**: Run consistently across development, testing, and production
- **Isolated**: Applications and dependencies packaged together
- **Efficient**: Run many more containers than VMs on the same hardware

Docker's key innovations:
- Simplified container creation with Dockerfile
- Standardized container format
- Container registries for sharing images
- Rich ecosystem of tools and services

Containers represent the evolution from monolithic physical servers to highly efficient, portable application deployment units.

## Containers: Definition

Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. They isolate software from its environment and ensure it works uniformly despite differences in infrastructure.
