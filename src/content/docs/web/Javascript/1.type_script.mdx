# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It compiles down to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or Node.js environment.

## Core Features

### Static Typing

```typescript
// Variables with types
let name: string = "Alice";
let age: number = 30;
let active: boolean = true;

// Function with typed parameters and return type
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email?: string; // Optional property
}

function greetUser(user: User) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}!`);
}
```

### Type Inference

TypeScript can automatically detect types:

```typescript
// No type annotations needed
let name = "Alice"; // TypeScript knows this is a string
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // TypeScript knows this is number[]
```

## Common Misconceptions

1. **TypeScript is a different language from JavaScript**
   - Reality: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.

2. **TypeScript improves runtime performance**
   - Reality: TypeScript only helps during development. The compiled JavaScript has identical performance.

3. **TypeScript guarantees type safety**
   - Reality: TypeScript has escape hatches (`any`, type assertions) and can't catch all errors.

4. **TypeScript requires types for everything**
   - Reality: Type inference often means you don't need explicit type annotations.

5. **TypeScript is only for large projects**
   - Reality: Even small projects benefit from improved tooling and early error detection.

## When to Use TypeScript

- When building larger applications
- When working with a team
- When you want better tooling and IDE support
- When maintaining code long-term
