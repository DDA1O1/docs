## Overview

Web animations should serve different purposes depending on the type of website they're on. This guide explains where and when to use animations effectively across various web platforms to enhance user experience without being distracting or hindering performance.

## Animation Use by Website Category

Here's a breakdown of how animation usage typically varies:

### Business Logic Applications

*   **Purpose**: Support core business operations (e.g., CRMs, ERPs).
*   **Animation Usage**: Minimal, strictly functional. Focus on clarity and efficiency.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Subtle loading state indicators (spinners, progress bars).
    *   Clear feedback on form submissions (success/error indicators).
    *   Smooth transitions for status changes (e.g., order status updates).
*   **Core Approach**: Animations should support tasks, provide clear feedback, and avoid purely decorative elements.

---

### Database Interfaces

*   **Purpose**: Data management, retrieval, and interaction (e.g., admin panels, data grids).
*   **Animation Usage**: Performance-focused, clarifying data changes.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Smooth transitions when sorting or filtering data tables.
    *   Visual cues for record updates or deletions.
    *   Non-intrusive loading indicators during data fetching.
*   **Core Approach**: Use animations to subtly guide the user through data changes and interactions without causing delays.

---

### Analytics Platforms

*   **Purpose**: Data visualization, reporting, and trend analysis.
*   **Animation Usage**: Data-driven, helping to illustrate changes and insights.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Animated transitions between chart types or data points.
    *   Smooth updates to live graphs or dashboards.
    *   Interactive visualizations that respond to user input with animation.
*   **Core Approach**: Animations should help users understand data relationships and changes over time; clarity remains essential.

---

### Internal Tools

*   **Purpose**: Employee-facing utilities, dashboards, and internal processes.
*   **Animation Usage**: Functional, minimal, prioritizing speed and clarity.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Clear indication of state changes (e.g., toggles, saving status).
    *   Simple navigation transitions (e.g., sliding panels).
    *   System feedback animations (e.g., confirming an action).
*   **Core Approach**: Prioritize speed and task completion. Animations should support workflow, not hinder it.

---

### Marketing Sites

*   **Purpose**: Brand promotion, user engagement, product showcasing, lead generation.
*   **Animation Usage**: Can be rich and engaging, often used to create a specific brand feel.
*   **Key Aspects**:
    *   Frequently found on landing pages to make a strong first impression.
    *   Designed to capture attention and guide the user's eye.
    *   Showcases features, benefits, and brand identity visually.
    *   Often more complex, involving scroll-triggered animations, micro-interactions, and decorative effects.
*   **Core Approach**: Engaging & Brand-Focused. Animations are often integral to the design, aiming to delight users and communicate brand personality. Performance still matters, but visual impact is a higher priority.

## Accessibility Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Accessibility is Crucial">
Animations can create barriers for users if not implemented thoughtfully. Always follow accessibility best practices to ensure your site is usable by everyone. Refer to the official [WCAG Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG) for detailed information.

### Core Principles (POUR)

Your animations should adhere to these fundamental accessibility principles:

1.  **Perceivable**: Animations and their content must be detectable by users, regardless of sensory abilities. Provide text alternatives or descriptions where necessary. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.
2.  **Operable**: Users must be able to control or bypass animations that could cause distraction or physical reactions. Include pause, stop, or hide controls for animations that start automatically and last more than 5 seconds.
3.  **Understandable**: The purpose and function of the animation should be clear. Avoid animations that are overly complex, disorienting, or contradict the user's understanding of the interface.
4.  **Robust**: Animations should work reliably across different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies. Use standard web technologies and provide fallbacks if cutting-edge features are used.

### Best Practices for Accessible Animations

*   **Respect User Preferences**: Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or simplify non-essential animations for users who request it.
*   **Avoid Rapid Flashing**: Do not use animations that flash more than three times per second, as this can trigger seizures (WCAG 2.3.1).
*   **Provide Control**: Give users control over animations, especially those that loop or are long-running.
*   **Test Thoroughly**: Test animations with keyboard navigation, screen readers, and zoom tools. Consider users with vestibular disorders who might be sensitive to motion.
*   **Ensure Readability**: Make sure text remains readable during and after animation sequences.

<Aside type="danger" title="Performance Considerations">
Heavy or poorly optimized animations can severely impact user experience. Avoid CPU-intensive animations (often those manipulating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, etc.) that can:
*   Degrade page loading speed and responsiveness.
*   Drain battery life, especially on mobile devices.
*   Cause visual lag, stuttering, or browser freezes ("jank").
*   Prefer GPU-accelerated properties like `transform` and `opacity` for smoother performance.
