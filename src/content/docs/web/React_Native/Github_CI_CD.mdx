title: Automating Android Releases with GitHub Actions CI/CD
description: Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build, sign, and release your Android application when you push a version tag.
---

This guide walks you through setting up a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will automatically build a signed release APK for your Android application whenever you push a git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) or manually trigger the workflow.

## Prerequisites

*   An Android project within your repository (likely in an `android` subfolder if integrated with another framework).
*   A GitHub repository for your project.
*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed locally if your project requires JS dependencies (common in cross-platform frameworks).
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed locally for generating the keystore.

## Step 1: Generate Your Release Keystore

The release keystore contains the private key required to sign your Android application, verifying you as the author.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the `android/app` directory within your project (or wherever you want to store the keystore initially).
3.  Run the `keytool` command (part of the JDK):

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias your-key-alias
    ```

4.  **Important:**
    *   Replace `your-key-alias` with a unique name for your key. Remember this alias.
    *   You will be prompted to create passwords for the keystore (`storePassword`) and the key alias (`keyPassword`). Choose strong passwords and **remember them securely**. These will be needed for GitHub Secrets.
    *   You'll also be asked for identification details (Name, Organization, etc.). Fill these out appropriately.

    This command generates a `release.keystore` file in your current directory. **Do not commit this file directly to your Git repository.**

## Step 2: Configure Android Gradle Build (`build.gradle`)

Modify your app-level `build.gradle` file (usually `android/app/build.gradle`) to read signing information from environment variables, which will be securely provided by GitHub Actions secrets.

1.  Locate the `android { ... }` block in your `build.gradle` file.
2.  Inside the `android` block, find or add the `signingConfigs { ... }` block.
3.  Inside `signingConfigs`, modify or add the `release { ... }` block as follows:

    ```groovy
    android {
        // ... other configurations like compileSdkVersion, defaultConfig ...

        signingConfigs {
            debug {
                // Debug signing config (usually default)
                storeFile file('../debug.keystore') // Or your debug keystore path
                storePassword 'android'
                keyAlias 'androiddebugkey'
                keyPassword 'android'
            }
            release {
                // Read signing configuration from environment variables
                // Set by GitHub Actions secrets
                if (System.getenv("ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH") != null &&
                    System.getenv("ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD") != null &&
                    System.getenv("ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS") != null &&
                    System.getenv("ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD") != null) {

                    storeFile file(System.getenv("ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH")) // We'll set this path in the workflow
                    storePassword System.getenv("ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD")
                    keyAlias System.getenv("ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS")
                    keyPassword System.getenv("ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD")
                } else {
                    println("Warning: Release signing environment variables not fully set. Release signing disabled.")
                    // Optionally disable release signing or throw an error if variables aren't set
                    // signingConfig null // Uncomment this line if you want builds to fail without secrets
                }
            }
        }

        buildTypes {
            debug {
                // Debug build type config
                signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
            }
            release {
                // ... other release build type settings like minifyEnabled, shrinkResources ...

                // Ensure the release build type uses the release signing config
                signingConfig signingConfigs.release // <--- MAKE SURE THIS LINE USES signingConfigs.release
            }
        }
        // ... rest of the android block ...
    }
    ```

4.  **Crucially**, ensure that within the `buildTypes { release { ... } }` block, the `signingConfig` is set to `signingConfigs.release`.

## Step 3: Encode Keystore to Base64

GitHub Secrets cannot store binary files directly. You need to encode your `release.keystore` file into a Base64 text string.

*   **On Linux/macOS:**

    ```bash
    base64 release.keystore > release.keystore.base64
    ```
    Or, to copy directly to clipboard on macOS:
    ```bash
    base64 release.keystore | pbcopy
    ```
    On Linux (requires `xclip`):
    ```bash
    base64 release.keystore | xclip -selection clipboard
    ```

*   **On Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release.keystore")) | Out-File -FilePath release.keystore.base64.txt -Encoding ASCII
    ```
    Or copy to clipboard:
    ```powershell
    [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release.keystore")) | Set-Clipboard
    ```

Copy the entire Base64 encoded string generated by these commands. You'll need it for the next step.

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets

Securely store your signing credentials and the encoded keystore in your GitHub repository settings.

1.  Navigate to your GitHub Repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3.  Under **Repository secrets**, click **New repository secret** four times to create the following secrets:

    *   **Name:** `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
        **Secret:** Paste the entire Base64 encoded string of your `release.keystore` file from Step 3.

    *   **Name:** `ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD`
        **Secret:** Enter the plain text password you created for the `release.keystore` file itself.

    *   **Name:** `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
        **Secret:** Enter the plain text alias name you chose for your key (e.g., `your-key-alias`).

    *   **Name:** `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
        **Secret:** Enter the plain text password you created for the specific key alias (this might be the same as the store password, or different).

## Step 5: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create a YAML file that defines the CI/CD pipeline.

1.  In your project's root directory, create the folders `.github/workflows/` if they don't exist.
2.  Inside `.github/workflows/`, create a file named `android-release.yml`.
3.  Paste the following content into `android-release.yml`:

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/android-release.yml

    name: Android Release Build

    on:
      # Allows manual triggering from the GitHub Actions UI
      workflow_dispatch:
      # Triggers on pushing tags matching the v*.*.* pattern (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.3.4)
      push:
        tags:
          - 'v*.*.*'

    jobs:
      build-android:
        name: Build Signed Android Release APK
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        # Permissions needed to create a GitHub Release
        permissions:
          contents: write

        # Define environment variables accessible to all steps in this job
        env:
          # Standard signing credentials from secrets
          ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD }}
          ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS }}
          ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD }}
          # Define the path where the keystore will be decoded within the runner
          ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/android/app/release.keystore

          # === WORKAROUND FOR CHECKING SECRET PRESENCE ===
          # Sets 'true'/'false' string based on whether the Base64 secret exists and is non-empty
          KEYSTORE_SECRET_IS_SET: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64 != '' }}
          # ==============================================

        steps:
          # Step 1: Checkout Repository
          - name: Checkout Repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # Step 2: Set up JDK 17 (Adjust version if needed)
          - name: Set up JDK 17

              # Ensure the target directory exists
              mkdir -p android/app
              # Decode the Base64 secret and write to the path defined in env var
              echo "${{ secrets.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}" | base64 --decode > ${{ env.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH }}
              echo "Keystore decoded successfully to ${{ env.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH }}"
              # Verify the file was created
              if [ ! -f "${{ env.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH }}" ]; then
                echo "::error::Keystore file was not created after decoding!"
                exit 1
              fi
              ls -l ${{ env.ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH }}

          - name: Handle Missing Keystore Secret
            # Only run if the KEYSTORE_SECRET_IS_SET env var is 'false'
            if: env.KEYSTORE_SECRET_IS_SET == 'false'
            run: |
              echo "::error::Required secret ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64 is not set or is empty. Cannot sign the release build."
              exit 1 # Fail the workflow explicitly

          # Step 7: Make gradlew executable
          - name: Make gradlew executable
            run: chmod +x ./android/gradlew

          # Step 8: Build Release APK
          - name: Build Release APK
            working-directory: ./android # Navigate to the android directory
            # Run the Gradle wrapper command to clean and assemble the release build
            run: ./gradlew clean assembleRelease
            # Add --no-daemon if you encounter Gradle daemon issues: ./gradlew clean assembleRelease --no-daemon

          # Step 9: Upload Release APK Artifact
          - name: Upload Release APK Artifact
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

              name: release-apks # Name of the artifact bundle
              # Path to the generated APK(s) - may vary slightly based on flavors/splits
              path: |
                android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/*.apk
              retention-days: 7 # How long to keep the artifact

          # Step 10: Create GitHub Release (Only runs on tag push)
          - name: Create GitHub Release
            # Condition: Only run if the trigger was a tag push
            if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
            uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
            with:
              # Use the tag name (e.g., v1.0.0) for the release
              tag_name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
              name: Release ${{ github.ref_name }} # Name of the GitHub Release
              # Files to attach to the release
              files: |
                android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/*.apk
            env:
              # The GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by GitHub Actions
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

4.  Commit and push this new file (`.github/workflows/android-release.yml`) to your repository.

## Step 6: Triggering the Workflow

The workflow will now run automatically when:

1.  You push a tag to your repository that matches the pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0`, `git push origin v1.0.0`).
2.  You manually trigger it from the GitHub Actions tab in your repository (Select the "Android Release Build" workflow and click "Run workflow").

## Step 7: Workflow Execution and Outcome

When the workflow runs successfully:

1.  It checks out your code.
2.  Sets up Java, Node.js (if needed), and the Android SDK.
3.  Decodes the Base64 keystore secret back into the `release.keystore` file within the runner environment at the path specified (`android/app/release.keystore`).
4.  Runs the `./gradlew assembleRelease` command, which uses the decoded keystore and the passwords/alias from the secrets (via environment variables) to build and sign your APK.
5.  Uploads the generated `*.apk` file(s) as a build artifact named `release-apks`. You can download this artifact from the workflow run summary page.
6.  **If triggered by a tag push**, it creates a new GitHub Release named after the tag (e.g., "Release v1.0.0") and attaches the signed `*.apk` file(s) to it.
