## Github Codespaces

Github Codespaces is a development environment that is hosted and managed by Github. It is a browser-based development environment that allows you to code anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

### Why Use Github Codespaces for React Native Development

Building React Native applications locally can be demanding on system resources. The process of configuring, building, and executing React Native apps often consumes significant CPU and memory resources, causing your computer to heat up considerably. While doing this occasionally might be manageable, repeatedly building and testing React Native applications can take a toll on computers with limited resources, especially those with less than 8GB of RAM.

#### Benefits of Github Codespaces:

- **Access to Higher Compute Resources**: Codespaces provides Ubuntu-based virtual machines with higher specifications than many local development machines.
  
- **Pre-configured Development Environment**: The IDE comes already set up with the necessary tools for React Native development, eliminating the need for complex local configurations.
  
- **Reduced Local Resource Usage**: Your local machine acts primarily as a terminal to the cloud-based development environment, significantly reducing CPU and memory usage.
  
- **Consistent Development Experience**: Work with the same environment across different machines without worrying about configuration differences.
  
- **Device Independence**: Develop on any device with a browser, even on hardware that would normally struggle with React Native development.

#### Setting Up React Native in Github Codespaces

- Any new machine will already have nodejs(v18.20.7/ v20.19.0/) and java(17.0.14-ms/ 21.0.6-ms/) installed.

Now we need to set up `Android Command Line Tools`:

```bash
  . Creates the android-sdk directory in your home directory (~)
  mkdir -p ~/android-sdk
  cd ~/android-sdk
  . Downloads the command line tools
  wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip
  . Unzips the command line tools
  unzip commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip
  . Creates a directory path cmdline-tools/latest.
  mkdir cmdline-tools/latest
  . Moves all contents from cmdline-tools/ to cmdline-tools/latest/
  mv cmdline-tools/* cmdline-tools/latest/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

Now we need to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
  . This line sets the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to the location of your Android SDK, which is assumed to be in the android-sdk directory within your home folder.
  echo "export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android-sdk" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now we need to set the `PATH` environment variable so that you can use the Android SDK tools from the command line:

```bash
  . This line appends the android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin and android-sdk/platform-tools directories to the PATH environment variable.
  echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

Now we need to install the Android SDK components:

```bash
. Accept the licenses
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
. Install the Android SDK components
~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0" "ndk;26.1.10909125"
```

```bash
cd /workspaces/react-native && npm install
cd android
. Make the gradlew file executable
chmod +x gradlew
. Clean and build the app
./gradlew clean && ./gradlew assembleDebug
. Install the app on the device by downloading the apk
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
```bash
- {/* once installed, run this command on the codespace terminal to start the app */}
npx react-native start
- {/* it will create an metrodevelopment server on codespace make sure to make it public copy the url and open your app on your phone.Shake your phone to open the dev menu -> Go to settings -> Debug server host & port for device -> paste the url without http:// or https:// -> click on Reload/reopen app */}
```
### Release the apk
- This is a security best practice for storing signing credentials. Instead of hardcoding passwords directly in build.gradle   (which might end up in version control), you keep them in a separate file that's excluded from git. The properties file would contain values like:

In build.gradle file
```gradle
// Creates a File object that points to the keystore.properties file in your app directory
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("app/keystore.properties")
// Creates a new Properties object, which can hold key-value pairs
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
// Checks if the properties file exists
// If it exists, loads its contents into the keystoreProperties object
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) { keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile)) }
```
- To read the key value pairs

in android.singingconfig.release
```gradle
release {
            storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
        }
```        
in the builtype change singingconfig to release type
```gradle
signingConfig signingConfigs.release
```
to generate the release.keystore since you are releasing now
```bash
 keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/app/release.keystore -alias your-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 
 ```
 create a file called keystore.properties like you create environment variables
 ```javascript
storeFile=release.keystore
storePassword=<your password>
keyAlias=your-key-alias
keyPassword=<same password>
```
