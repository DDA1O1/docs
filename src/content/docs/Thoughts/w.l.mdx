## Introduction 🌐

- Life is not black and white for everyone.You neither have tremendous amount of money nor you are a superstar.
- For normies like you and me we can control few of the things but we cannot control all of the things.

## Priorities 📝

- Each day, week and month your priorities are different.
- To change them you need to convince yourself that this task is more important than your priorities.

- But you can change your small habits:

  - Like that water bottle on your desk - make it clean and transparent. If it looks good, you'll drink from it. If it looks sad, you'll ignore it like Monday mornings.
  - Like skipping the gym? Clean your house instead. It's still exercise but with instant results. Your house looks better AND you burned calories. Win-win. No waiting for those gym gains that never come.

:::note
- Habits should be very simple and driven by some kind of reward.
- The moment you add little complexity your habit will just exist on paper.

### Curiosity Killed the Cat 🐱

- Curiosity is good but it's also a time killer.
- Be selective with your curiosity:
  - You have limited daily energy
  - Spend it where you see clear returns (money/rewards)
  - If you can't see the direct benefit, the answer is `NO`

## A Good Sleep 💤

- **Instead of banging your head against the wall, take a nap.Either something will click or you will realize that it's not worth it.**
- Do not let your `EGO` tell you that you are not smart enough to understand something.
