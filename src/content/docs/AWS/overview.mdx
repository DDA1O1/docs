# Getting Started with AWS

## Account Setup

1. **Create an AWS Account**
   - Visit [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/)
   - Click "Create an AWS Account"
   - Provide email, password, and account name
   - Complete the verification process

2. **Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Go to IAM dashboard
   - Select your username
   - Configure MFA device (recommended: authenticator app)

3. **Create IAM Users**
   - Avoid using root account for daily tasks
   - Create admin IAM user with appropriate permissions
   - Generate access keys only when needed for specific services

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable CloudTrail**
   - Tracks all API calls in your account
   - Set up in the CloudTrail console
   - Store logs in a dedicated S3 bucket

2. **Configure Billing Alerts**
   - Set up in Billing dashboard
   - Create budget with notifications
   - Set CloudWatch alarms for spending thresholds

3. **Implement Least Privilege Access**
   - Grant minimal permissions needed
   - Use IAM roles for services
   - Regularly review and audit permissions



## AWS CLI and SDK Setup

1. **Install AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   # For Windows (PowerShell)
   msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

   # For macOS
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /

   # For Linux
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter your access key, secret key, default region, and output format
   ```

3. **Install SDK for Your Programming Language**
   - [Python (Boto3)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html)
   - [JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-started.html)
