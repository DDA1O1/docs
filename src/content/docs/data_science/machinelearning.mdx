## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be divided into three main categories based on how models learn from data.

### 1. Supervised Learning
Models learn from labeled data to make predictions.

#### How it Works
- Input: Data with known answers (labels)
- Process: Model learns patterns between features and labels
- Output: Predictions for new data

#### Types
1. **Classification** (Predicts categories)
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Disease Classification Example
class DiseaseClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
    
    def train(self, symptoms, diagnoses):
        """Train with patient symptoms and known diagnoses"""
        self.model.fit(symptoms, diagnoses)
    
    def predict(self, patient_symptoms):
        """Predict disease category"""
        return self.model.predict([patient_symptoms])[0]

# Example Usage
symptoms = [
    [1, 0, 1],  # Patient 1: [fever, cough, fatigue]
    [0, 1, 0],  # Patient 2
    [1, 1, 1]   # Patient 3
]
diagnoses = ['flu', 'cold', 'flu']

classifier = DiseaseClassifier()
classifier.train(symptoms, diagnoses)
new_patient = [1, 0, 1]
prediction = classifier.predict(new_patient)
```

2. **Regression** (Predicts numbers)
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# House Price Prediction
class PricePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
    
    def train(self, features, prices):
        """Train with house features and known prices"""
        self.model.fit(features, prices)
    
    def predict(self, house_features):
        """Predict house price"""
        return self.model.predict([house_features])[0]

# Example Usage
features = [
    [1500, 3],  # [size, bedrooms]
    [2000, 4],
    [1200, 2]
]
prices = [300000, 450000, 250000]

predictor = PricePredictor()
predictor.train(features, prices)
new_house = [1800, 3]
price = predictor.predict(new_house)
```

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Models find patterns in unlabeled data.

#### How it Works
- Input: Data without labels
- Process: Model discovers inherent patterns
- Output: Groups or structures in data

#### Types
1. **Clustering** (Groups similar items)
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

class CustomerSegmentation:
    def __init__(self, n_clusters=3):
        self.model = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters)
    
    def segment(self, customer_data):
        """Group customers by behavior"""
        return self.model.fit_predict(customer_data)

# Example Usage
customers = [
    [100, 20],  # [spending, visits]
    [500, 50],
    [50, 10]
]
segmentation = CustomerSegmentation()
segments = segmentation.segment(customers)
```

2. **Dimensionality Reduction** (Simplifies data)
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

class ImageCompressor:
    def __init__(self, n_components=2):
        self.model = PCA(n_components=n_components)
    
    def compress(self, images):
        """Reduce image dimensions"""
        return self.model.fit_transform(images)

# Example Usage
images = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],  # Each row is a flattened image
    [2, 3, 4, 5],
    [3, 4, 5, 6]
]
compressor = ImageCompressor()
compressed = compressor.compress(images)
```

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Models learn through trial and error with rewards.

#### How it Works
- Input: Environment state
- Process: Agent takes actions and receives rewards
- Output: Optimal action policy

```python
class GameAgent:
    def __init__(self, states, actions):
        self.q_table = {}  # State-action values
        
    def choose_action(self, state):
        """Choose best action for current state"""
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = [0] * len(self.actions)
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        """Update knowledge based on reward"""
        old_value = self.q_table[state][action]
        next_max = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])
        self.q_table[state][action] = old_value + 0.1 * (reward + 0.9 * next_max - old_value)

# Example Usage
agent = GameAgent(states=['start', 'middle', 'end'], actions=['left', 'right'])
state = 'start'
action = agent.choose_action(state)
```

### Key Differences

1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised**
   - Supervised: Has correct answers to learn from
   - Unsupervised: Finds patterns without answers

2. **Supervised vs Reinforcement**
   - Supervised: Learns from static examples
   - Reinforcement: Learns from dynamic interaction

3. **Unsupervised vs Reinforcement**
   - Unsupervised: Finds structure in data
   - Reinforcement: Learns optimal behavior

### When to Use Each

1. **Use Supervised Learning When**
   - You have labeled data
   - Need specific predictions
   - Have clear input-output pairs

2. **Use Unsupervised Learning When**
   - Data isn't labeled
   - Want to discover patterns
   - Need to reduce data complexity

3. **Use Reinforcement Learning When**
   - Have interactive environment
   - Can define clear rewards
   - Need adaptive behavior

### Common Applications

   - Spam detection
   - Disease diagnosis
   - Price prediction
   - Image recognition

2. **Unsupervised Learning**

   - Anomaly detection
   - Feature extraction
   - Recommendation systems

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Game playing
   - Robot navigation
   - Resource management
   - Trading strategies

> **Remember**: Choose the learning type based on your data availability and problem requirements. Each type has its strengths and ideal use cases.

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models learn from labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Key Concepts

1. **Input Data (X)**: Features or predictors
2. **Output Data (y)**: Labels or target values
3. **Training**: Model learns patterns from X â†’ y mapping
4. **Prediction**: Model predicts y for new X

### Types of Supervised Learning

#### 1. Classification
- Predicts categorical outputs
- Examples: Yes/No, Cat/Dog/Bird

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Email Spam Classification
class SpamClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        
    def train(self, emails, labels):
        """
        Train spam classifier
        
        Args:
            emails: List of email features (word counts, etc.)
            labels: 1 for spam, 0 for not spam
        """
        self.model.fit(emails, labels)
    
    def predict(self, email):
        """Predict if email is spam"""
        prediction = self.model.predict([email])[0]
        return "Spam" if prediction == 1 else "Not Spam"

# Example Usage
features = [[1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [3, 1, 4]]  # Word counts: [money, friend, buy]
labels = [1, 0, 1]  # 1=spam, 0=not spam

classifier = SpamClassifier()
classifier.train(features, labels)

new_email = [2, 0, 3]  # New email features
result = classifier.predict(new_email)
print(f"Email classified as: {result}")
```

#### 2. Regression
- Predicts continuous numerical values
- Examples: Price, Temperature, Age

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

class HousePricePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
        
    def train(self, features, prices):
        """
        Train house price predictor
        
        Args:
            features: Array of [size, bedrooms, age]
            prices: Array of house prices
        """
        self.model.fit(features, prices)
    
    def predict(self, house):
        """Predict house price"""
        return self.model.predict([house])[0]

# Example Usage
features = [
    [1500, 3, 10],  # size, bedrooms, age
    [2000, 4, 5],
    [1200, 2, 15]
]
prices = [300000, 450000, 250000]

predictor = HousePricePredictor()
predictor.train(features, prices)

new_house = [1800, 3, 8]
price = predictor.predict(new_house)
print(f"Predicted price: ${price:,.2f}")
```

### Common Algorithms

    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        
    def train(self, transactions, fraud_labels):
        """
        Train fraud detector
        
        Args:
            transactions: Features [amount, time, location_code, etc.]
            fraud_labels: 1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate
        """
        self.model.fit(transactions, fraud_labels)
    
    def check_transaction(self, transaction):
        """Check if transaction is fraudulent"""
        risk_score = self.model.predict_proba([transaction])[0][1]
        return {
            'risk_score': risk_score,
            'flag_for_review': risk_score > 0.7
        }

# Example
detector = FraudDetector()
transaction = [1000, 3, 45]  # amount, time, location
result = detector.check_transaction(transaction)
print(f"Risk Score: {result['risk_score']:.2%}")
```

#### 2. Medical Diagnosis
```python
class DiseasePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        
    def train(self, patient_data, diagnoses):
        """
        Train disease predictor
        
        Args:
            patient_data: Features [symptoms, age, history, etc.]
            diagnoses: Disease labels
        """
        self.model.fit(patient_data, diagnoses)
    
    def predict_risk(self, patient):
        """Predict disease risk"""
        probability = self.model.predict_proba([patient])[0][1]
        return {
            'risk_level': 'High' if probability > 0.7 else 'Low',
            'probability': probability
        }

# Example
symptoms = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # fever, cough, fatigue, pain
result = DiseasePredictor().predict_risk(symptoms)
print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
```

### Best Practices

def evaluate_classifier(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculate classification metrics"""
    return {
        'accuracy': accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
        'precision': precision_score(y_true, y_pred),
        'recall': recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    }
```

#### Regression
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

def evaluate_regression(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculate regression metrics"""
    return {
        'mse': mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred),
        'r2': r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
    }
```

   - Spam detection
   - Disease diagnosis
   - Customer churn prediction
   - Image recognition

2. **Regression**
   - Price prediction
   - Sales forecasting
   - Temperature estimation
   - Resource consumption

> **Remember**: Success in supervised learning depends heavily on data quality and proper model selection for your specific problem.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels. Think of it like sorting clothes by color without knowing the color names.

#### Main Types

1. **Clustering**
   - Groups similar items together
   - Example: Grouping customers by shopping behavior

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Simplifies complex data
   - Example: Compressing images while keeping important features

#### Simple Examples

```python
# Clustering Example
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

class CustomerGrouping:
    def __init__(self, n_groups=3):
        self.model = KMeans(n_clusters=n_groups)
    
    def group_customers(self, data):
        """
        Group customers based on behavior
        data: Array of [purchase_amount, visit_frequency]
        """
        return self.model.fit_predict(data)

# Usage
customers = [
    [100, 5],   # [spending, visits]
    [500, 15],
    [50, 2]
]
groups = CustomerGrouping().group_customers(customers)
```

```python
# Dimensionality Reduction Example
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

class DataSimplifier:
    def __init__(self, n_features=2):
        self.model = PCA(n_components=n_features)
    
    def simplify(self, data):
        """
        Reduce data complexity
        data: Complex data with many features
        """
        return self.model.fit_transform(data)
```

#### When to Use

1. **Use Clustering When:**
   - Finding customer segments
   - Grouping similar documents
   - Detecting anomalies

2. **Use Dimensionality Reduction When:**
   - Reducing image size
   - Visualizing high-dimensional data
   - Removing noise from data

#### Common Algorithms

1. **Clustering**
   - K-means: Simple, fast grouping
   - DBSCAN: Finds clusters of any shape
   - Hierarchical: Creates tree of clusters

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - PCA: Linear data compression
   - t-SNE: Complex data visualization
   - Autoencoders: Neural network compression

#### Tips for Success

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Scale features to same range
   - Remove outliers if needed
   - Handle missing values

2. **Algorithm Selection**
   - Start with simple methods
   - K-means for clustering
   - PCA for dimension reduction

3. **Evaluation**
   - Check if groups make sense
   - Validate with domain experts
   - Use visualization tools


### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is like teaching through trial and error with rewards. Think of training a dog - good behavior gets treats, bad behavior doesn't.

#### Core Concepts

1. **Agent**: The learner (like a robot or game player)
2. **Environment**: Where the agent operates
3. **State**: Current situation
4. **Action**: What the agent can do
5. **Reward**: Feedback on how good an action was

#### Simple Example

```python
import numpy as np

class SimpleGameAgent:
    def __init__(self, states, actions):
        self.q_table = {}  # Stores state-action values
        self.states = states
        self.actions = actions
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount = 0.9
        
    def get_action(self, state, explore_rate=0.1):
        """Choose action: explore or exploit"""
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {a: 0 for a in self.actions}
            
        # Sometimes try random actions (explore)
        if np.random.random() < explore_rate:
            return np.random.choice(self.actions)
        
        # Usually pick best action (exploit)
        return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        """Update knowledge from experience"""
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = {a: 0 for a in self.actions}
            
        # Update Q-value based on reward
        old_value = self.q_table[state][action]
        next_best = max(self.q_table[next_state].values())
        new_value = (1 - self.learning_rate) * old_value + \
                   self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount * next_best)
        self.q_table[state][action] = new_value

# Example Usage
states = ['start', 'middle', 'end']
actions = ['left', 'right']

agent = SimpleGameAgent(states, actions)
current_state = 'start'
action = agent.get_action(current_state)
reward = 1  # Get reward from environment
next_state = 'middle'
agent.learn(current_state, action, reward, next_state)
```

#### Common Applications

1. **Games**
   - Chess
   - Video games
   - Board games

2. **Robotics**
   - Navigation
   - Manipulation
   - Walking

3. **Business**
   - Trading
   - Resource management
   - Ad placement

#### Key Algorithms

1. **Q-Learning**
   - Simple table-based learning
   - Good for small problems
   - Easy to understand

2. **Deep Q-Learning**
   - Uses neural networks
   - Good for complex problems
   - Handles large state spaces

3. **Policy Gradient**
   - Learns actions directly
   - Good for continuous actions
   - Used in robotics

#### Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use basic environments
   - Limit state/action space
   - Test frequently

2. **Handle Exploration**
   - Try random actions early
   - Reduce randomness over time
   - Balance explore/exploit

3. **Reward Design**
   - Clear goals
   - Immediate feedback
   - Consistent values

> **Note**: Reinforcement learning needs patience. Agents often perform poorly at first but improve with practice.

#### Equation of a Line, 3D Planes, and Hyperplanes

##### 1. Line Equation (2D)
A line is the simplest form of linear relationship:
```python
y = mx + b
# m = slope (rise/run)
# b = y-intercept
```

Example:
```python
def line_equation(x, m=2, b=1):
    """
    Calculate y value for a line
    Args:
        x: x coordinate
        m: slope
        b: y-intercept
    Returns:
        y coordinate
    """
    return m * x + b

# Example: y = 2x + 1
x_points = [0, 1, 2]
y_points = [line_equation(x) for x in x_points]
# y_points = [1, 3, 5]
```

##### 2. Plane Equation (3D)
A plane in 3D space:
```python
z = ax + by + c
# a, b = slopes in x and y directions
# c = z-intercept
```

Example:
```python
def plane_equation(x, y, a=1, b=1, c=0):
    """
    Calculate z value for a plane
    Args:
        x, y: coordinates
        a, b: slopes
        c: z-intercept
    Returns:
        z coordinate
    """
    return a * x + b * y + c

# Example: z = x + y
point = plane_equation(1, 2)  # z = 3
```

##### 3. Hyperplane (N dimensions)
For machine learning with multiple features:
```python
y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn + b
# w = weights
# x = features
# b = bias
```

Simple Linear Classifier:
```python
import numpy as np

class SimpleClassifier:
    def __init__(self, n_features):
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0
    
    def predict(self, features):
        """
        Classify using hyperplane
        Args:
            features: array of feature values
        Returns:
            1 if above plane, 0 if below
        """
        value = np.dot(features, self.weights) + self.bias
        return 1 if value > 0 else 0

# Example
classifier = SimpleClassifier(2)
classifier.weights = np.array([1, 1])
classifier.bias = -1

# Point (1, 1) is above plane
print(classifier.predict([1, 1]))  # 1

# Point (0, 0) is below plane
print(classifier.predict([0, 0]))  # 0
```

> **Key Points**:
> - Lines separate points in 2D
> - Planes separate points in 3D
> - Hyperplanes separate points in higher dimensions
> - Essential for linear classification and regression

#### Distance Of a Point to a Plane

The distance from a point to a plane is useful in machine learning for:
- Finding margins in SVM algorithms
- Calculating error in geometric models
- Determining point classifications

##### Formula
```python
from numpy import array, dot, sqrt

def point_to_plane_distance(point, plane_normal, plane_point):
    """
    Calculate shortest distance from point to plane
    
    Args:
        point: Array [x, y, z] - Point to measure from
        plane_normal: Array [a, b, c] - Normal vector to plane
        plane_point: Array [x, y, z] - Any point on plane
    
    Returns:
        distance: Absolute distance from point to plane
    """
    # Normalize the plane normal vector
    n = plane_normal / sqrt(dot(plane_normal, plane_normal))
    
    # Vector from plane to point
    v = point - plane_point
    
    # Distance is dot product of v and normalized normal
    return abs(dot(v, n))

# Example Usage
point = array([1, 1, 1])
plane_normal = array([0, 0, 1])  # Points up Z-axis
plane_point = array([0, 0, 0])   # Plane at Z=0

distance = point_to_plane_distance(point, plane_normal, plane_point)
# distance = 1.0 (point is 1 unit above XY plane)
```

##### Visual Example
- Plane: z = 0 (XY plane)
- Point: (1, 1, 1)
- Distance: 1 unit (straight up from plane)

> **Note**: The normal vector determines plane orientation. It points perpendicular to the plane surface.

### Instance Based Learning

Instance Based Learning (IBL) stores training examples to predict new cases, like using past experiences to make decisions.

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The most common IBL algorithm. Predicts based on closest training examples.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

class SimpleKNN:
    def __init__(self, k=3):
        self.model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        """Store training examples"""
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, x):
        """Predict using k closest neighbors"""
        return self.model.predict([x])[0]

# Example: Movie Recommendation
movies = [
    [3, 4],  # [length_hours, rating]
    [1, 5],
    [4, 2]
]
likes = ['yes', 'yes', 'no']

recommender = SimpleKNN(k=2)
recommender.train(movies, likes)
new_movie = [2, 4]
prediction = recommender.predict(new_movie)
```

#### Key Points
1. **Advantages**
   - Simple to understand
   - No training phase
   - Works with new data easily

2. **Disadvantages**
   - Slow with large datasets
   - Needs lots of memory
   - Sensitive to irrelevant features

#### When to Use
- Small to medium datasets
- When examples are similar to predictions
- When quick setup is needed

> **Note**: Choose k (number of neighbors) based on dataset size. Larger k reduces noise sensitivity.

### Model Based Learning

Model Based Learning finds patterns in data to make predictions. Think of it like creating a rule book from examples.

#### Basic Types

1. **Linear Models**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

class SimpleLinearModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        """Learn pattern from data"""
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, x):
        """Make prediction using learned pattern"""
        return self.model.predict([x])[0]

# Example: House Price Prediction
sizes = [[1000], [1500], [2000]]  # Square feet
prices = [200000, 300000, 400000]  # Prices

predictor = SimpleLinearModel()
predictor.train(sizes, prices)
new_size = [1750]
price = predictor.predict(new_size)
```

2. **Decision Trees**
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

class SimpleTreeModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)  # Keep it simple
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        """Learn decision rules"""
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, x):
        """Make decision using rules"""
        return self.model.predict([x])[0]

# Example: Loan Approval
data = [
    [50000, 3],  # [income, years_employed]
    [30000, 1],
    [70000, 5]
]
approved = ['yes', 'no', 'yes']

approver = SimpleTreeModel()
approver.train(data, approved)
new_application = [45000, 2]
decision = approver.predict(new_application)
```

#### When to Use

1. **Linear Models**
   - Simple relationships
   - Need explainable results
   - Limited data available

2. **Decision Trees**
   - Complex patterns
   - Need clear rules
   - Have enough data

#### Tips
- Start simple
- Use cross-validation
- Check model assumptions
- Monitor performance

> **Remember**: Simpler models often work better than complex ones.

### Pickling

Pickling is a way to save Python objects to files and load them back later. Think of it like saving your game progress.

#### Basic Usage

```python
import pickle

# Save object to file
def save_object(obj, filename):
    """Save any Python object to a file"""
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file)

# Load object from file
def load_object(filename):
    """Load a Python object from a file"""
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

# Example Usage
model = {'name': 'MyModel', 'score': 0.95}
save_object(model, 'model.pkl')
loaded_model = load_object('model.pkl')
```

#### Common Use Cases

1. **Save ML Models**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Train and save model
model = LinearRegression()
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6])
model.fit(X, y)
save_object(model, 'linear_model.pkl')

# Load and use model later
loaded_model = load_object('linear_model.pkl')
prediction = loaded_model.predict([[4]])
```

2. **Save Data Structures**
```python
# Save processed data
data = {
    'features': [1, 2, 3],
    'labels': ['A', 'B', 'C']
}
save_object(data, 'data.pkl')
```

#### Best Practices

1. **File Extensions**
   - Use `.pkl` or `.pickle`
   - Makes files easily identifiable

2. **Error Handling**
```python
def safe_save(obj, filename):
    """Save with error handling"""
    try:
        save_object(obj, filename)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error saving: {e}")
        return False
```

3. **Security Note**
   - Only unpickle files you trust
   - Pickled files can contain malicious code

> **Remember**: Pickling is for Python objects only. Use JSON for sharing data with other languages.
