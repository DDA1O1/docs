## What is Go?

Go (often called Golang) is an open-source, statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. Announced in 2009, it was created to improve programming productivity, especially for large-scale software, networked services, and multicore processors.

It draws inspiration from languages like C for performance but aims for simplicity and readability akin to Python. Key features include automatic memory management (garbage collection) and built-in support for concurrent programming.

## Why Go?

Go offers several compelling advantages:

*   **Simplicity & Readability:** Go has a clean, minimal syntax, making it relatively easy to learn, read, and maintain, even in large teams.
*   **Performance:** As a compiled language, Go applications compile directly to machine code, resulting in fast execution speeds comparable to C or C++. It also boasts fast compilation times.
*   **Concurrency:** Go makes concurrent programming straightforward with lightweight goroutines and channels, allowing efficient use of multi-core processors for scalable applications.
*   **Strong Tooling:** Go comes with a robust standard library and excellent built-in tools for formatting (`gofmt`), testing (`go test`), documentation (`godoc`), and dependency management.
*   **Scalability:** Its efficiency, concurrency model, and suitability for microservices and cloud-native applications make it excellent for building systems that need to handle significant load.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Go easily cross-compiles to different operating systems and architectures, simplifying deployment.

## Installation

You can install Go on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The primary method is downloading an installer or archive from the official Go website.

### Official Download

1.  Visit the official Go downloads page: [go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
2.  Download the appropriate package for your operating system (Windows `.msi`, macOS `.pkg`, Linux `.tar.gz`).

### Installation Steps

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Windows">
1.  Run the downloaded MSI installer.
2.  Follow the prompts. By default, Go is installed in `C:\Program Files\Go` (or `C:\Go` in some versions) and the `C:\Go\bin` directory will be added to your system `PATH` environment variable.
3.  Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window (important to apply PATH changes) and verify the installation:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
    This should print the installed Go version.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">
1.  Run the downloaded PKG installer.
2.  Follow the prompts. Go will be installed in `/usr/local/go` and the `/usr/local/go/bin` directory should be added to your `PATH`.
3.  Open a new Terminal window (important to apply PATH changes) and verify the installation:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
    This should print the installed Go version.
4.  If the command isn't found, you may need to manually add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your PATH by editing your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.profile`). Add the line:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    Then, reload the profile (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc`) or open a new terminal window.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux (Tarball)">
1.  **Remove previous installations (if any):** It's recommended to remove any existing Go installation located at `/usr/local/go` before installing a new version from the tarball:
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ```
2.  **Extract the archive:** Extract the downloaded tarball into `/usr/local`. This will create a new Go tree in `/usr/local/go`:
    ```bash
    # Replace go1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz with the actual filename
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
3.  **Add Go to PATH:** Add the Go binary directory to your system's PATH environment variable. Edit your shell profile file (`~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc`) and add the following line:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
4.  **Apply changes:** Reload your profile file (e.g., `source ~/.profile`) or log out and log back in.
5.  **Verify installation:** Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
    This should print the installed Go version.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux (Package Managers)">
*   **Debian/Ubuntu:** While the official tarball method is recommended for the latest version, you might install using `apt` (though it might not be the most recent Go release):
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install golang-go
    ```
    Alternatively, PPAs or snaps might offer newer versions.
*   **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install golang
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    sudo yum install golang
    ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify Installation

Regardless of the method, always verify your installation by opening a **new** terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
go version
```

## Variables, Types, and Constants

Understanding how Go handles data through variables, types, and constants is fundamental.

### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. Go is statically typed, meaning a variable's type is checked at compile time.

#### Declaration

You can declare variables using the var keyword.

**Declare with type:**
```go
var age int // Declares an integer variable named 'age'
age = 30   // Assigns a value
```

**Declare and initialize:**
```go
var name string = "Alice" // Declares and initializes a string variable
```

**Type inference:** Go can infer the type if an initial value is provided.
```go
var isReady = true // Go infers 'isReady' is of type bool
```

**Multiple variables:**
```go
var x, y int = 10, 20 // Declare multiple variables of the same type
var (
    city    string = "London"
    country string = "UK"
) // Block declaration
```

#### Short Variable Declaration (:=)

Inside functions, you can use the := short assignment statement for implicit declaration and initialization. This is the most common way to declare variables within functions.

```go
func main() {
    message := "Hello, Go!" // Declares 'message' as string and initializes it
    count := 1             // Declares 'count' as int and initializes it
    isValid := false       // Declares 'isValid' as bool and initializes it

    // Cannot use := outside a function
    // port := 8080 // This would cause a compile error at the package level
}
```

Note: := can only be used when at least one variable on the left side is newly declared.

#### Zero Values

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value:

- 0 for numeric types (int, float, etc.)
- false for booleans
- "" (empty string) for strings
- nil for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps.

```go
var i int     // i == 0
var f float64 // f == 0.0
var b bool    // b == false
var s string  // s == ""
var p *int    // p == nil
```

### Data Types

Go has several built-in data types:

#### Basic Types

- Boolean: bool (true or false)
- String: string (sequence of bytes, usually representing UTF-8 encoded text)
- Integer:
  - Signed: int, int8, int16, int32, int64
  - Unsigned: uint, uint8 (alias byte), uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr
  - int, uint, and uintptr are platform-dependent sizes (32 or 64 bits)
- Floating-Point: float32, float64
- Complex: complex64, complex128

#### Composite Types

**Array:** [n]T (fixed-size sequence of type T)
```go
var numbers [5]int // Array of 5 integers, initialized to 0
```

**Slice:** []T (dynamically-sized view into an underlying array of type T)
```go
letters := []string{"a", "b", "c"} // Slice of strings
```

**Map:** map[K]V (unordered collection of key-value pairs)
```go
ages := map[string]int{"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25} // Map string keys to int values
```

**Struct:** struct (collection of named fields)
```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
p := Person{Name: "Charlie", Age: 35}
```

### Type Conversion

Go requires explicit type conversions:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i) // Explicit conversion from int to float64
var u uint = uint(f)       // Explicit conversion from float64 to uint (truncates)
```

### Constants

Constants are values that are fixed at compile time. They are declared using the const keyword.

**Basic constant declaration:**
```go
const Pi float64 = 3.14159 // Typed constant
const World = "世界"       // Untyped string constant
const Truth = true         // Untyped boolean constant

const (
    StatusOK    = 200
    StatusError = 500
) // Grouped constants

// iota is a special constant generator for sequential values
const (
    C0 = iota // C0 == 0
    C1 = iota // C1 == 1
    C2 = iota // C2 == 2
)
```

**Typed vs. Untyped Constants:**
```go
const UntypedInt = 1000
const TypedInt int = 10

var f float64 = UntypedInt // OK: UntypedInt can become float64
var i int = UntypedInt     // OK: UntypedInt can become int

// var f2 float64 = TypedInt // Error: cannot use TypedInt (type int) as type float64
var f2 float64 = float64(TypedInt) // OK: Explicit conversion required
```
