## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.

### Why Git is needed:

- **Version history**: Maintains a complete history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously
- **Branching**: Supports creating separate branches for developing features without affecting the main codebase
- **Offline work**: Allows working locally without constant connection to a central server
- **Backup**: Serves as a backup system for your code and project files

### Install Git

Git is available on all major operating systems. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

```bash
git --version
```

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds a visual interface and additional features on top of Git's functionality.There are several other services that provide similar functionality to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

### GitHub Features:

- **Repository hosting**: Stores Git repositories in the cloud
- **Pull requests**: Facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes
- **Issues tracking**: Manages bugs, enhancements, and tasks
- **Project management**: Provides boards and tools to organize work
- **Actions**: Enables automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration tools**: Offers features like discussions, wikis, and team management

## Basic Git Commands

### Initialize a repository

```bash
git init
```
### Check the status of the repository

you should always check the status of the repository before you start working on it.

```bash
git status
```

### Add files to the repository

```bash
git add <file>
```
### Commit changes

It is a checkpoint of the changes you have made to the files.

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Push changes to the repository

After committing your changes locally, you need to push them to the remote repository to make them available to others.

```bash
git push
```
