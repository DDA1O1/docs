# Git & GitHub Overview

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.

### Why Git is needed:

- **Version history**: Maintains a complete history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously
- **Branching**: Supports creating separate branches for developing features without affecting the main codebase
- **Offline work**: Allows working locally without constant connection to a central server
- **Backup**: Serves as a backup system for your code and project files


## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds a visual interface and additional features on top of Git's functionality.There are several other services that provide similar functionality to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

### GitHub Features:

- **Repository hosting**: Stores Git repositories in the cloud
- **Pull requests**: Facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes
- **Issues tracking**: Manages bugs, enhancements, and tasks
- **Project management**: Provides boards and tools to organize work
- **Actions**: Enables automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration tools**: Offers features like discussions, wikis, and team management
