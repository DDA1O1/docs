## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.

### Why Git is needed:

-   **Version history**: Maintains a complete history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions.
-   **Collaboration**: Enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.
-   **Branching**: Supports creating separate branches for developing features without affecting the main codebase.
-   **Offline work**: Allows working locally without constant connection to a central server.
-   **Backup**: Serves as a backup system for your code and project files.

### Install Git

Git is available on all major operating systems. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Check if you already have it and what version:
```bash
git --version
```

#### Git Config

<Aside type="note" title="Important First Step!">
Before you start using Git, you need to configure your username and email address. This is so Git knows who *you* are when you make changes.
</Aside>

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds a visual interface and additional features on top of Git's functionality.

<Aside type="note">
There are several other services that provide similar functionality to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket. They work with Git too!
</Aside>

### GitHub Features:

-   **Repository hosting**: Stores Git repositories in the cloud.
-   **Pull requests**: Facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes.
-   **Issues tracking**: Manages bugs, enhancements, and tasks.
-   **Project management**: Provides boards and tools to organize work.
-   **Actions**: Enables automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Collaboration tools**: Offers features like discussions, wikis, and team management.

## Basic Git Commands

Here are some fundamental commands you'll use often.

### Initialize a repository (`git init`)

Turns your current directory into a Git repository.

```bash
git init
```
-   This will create a new hidden directory called `.git` in your project folder.
-   This `.git` directory contains all the repository's tracking information and history. Don't delete it!

### Check the status (`git status`)

Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

<Aside type="tip">
You should *always* check the status of the repository before you start working on it, and frequently while you work. It tells you what Git sees.
</Aside>

```bash
git status
```

### Add files to staging (`git add`)

Tells Git you want to track changes in specific files for the *next* commit. This is called "staging" changes.

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add <file-name.js>

# Add all changed files in the current directory and subdirectories
git add .
```

### Commit changes (`git commit`)

Saves the currently staged changes to the repository's history. Think of it as creating a checkpoint or snapshot of your project.

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```
<Aside type="caution">
Write meaningful commit messages! They explain *why* a change was made and help you (and others) understand the history later.
</Aside>

### Push changes (`git push`)

Uploads your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub), making them available to collaborators.

<Steps>
1.  **Connect to GitHub (if needed):**
    It's highly recommended to connect using SSH keys for security and convenience. You can generate these and add them in your GitHub account settings. See the official documentation: [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

2.  **Link Local Repo to Remote:**
    If you created the repo locally (`git init`), you need to tell Git where the remote version lives (usually on GitHub). You typically only do this once per project. `origin` is the standard name for your main remote repository.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository-url-from-github.git>
    ```

3.  **Push Your Commits:**
    The first time you push a new branch (like `main`), use `-u` to set the "upstream" tracking relationship. This tells Git where to push to and pull from for this branch by default.
    ```bash
    # First push for the main branch
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    After the first push, you can usually just use:
    ```bash
    # Push subsequent commits on the current branch
    git push
    ```
</Steps>

### See Commit History (`git log`)

Displays the commit history for the current branch.

```bash
git log

# Show a condensed, one-line summary of each commit
git log --oneline
```

### Ignore Files (`.gitignore`)

Sometimes you have files or directories you *don't* want Git to track (like temporary files, dependency folders, or secret keys).

<Steps>
1.  **Create the file:** In the root directory of your project:
    ```bash
    touch .gitignore
    ```
2.  **Add patterns:** List the files or directories you want Git to ignore, one per line.
    ```gitignore
    # Example .gitignore file

    # Dependency directories
    node_modules/
    vendor/

    # Build output
    dist/
    build/

    # Files with sensitive information
    .env
    *.pem
    secrets.json

    # OS-generated files
    .DS_Store
    Thumbs.db
    ```
    <Aside type="tip">GitHub provides many standard `.gitignore` templates for different languages and frameworks: [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)</Aside>
</Steps>

### Branching (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`)

Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main (`main` or `master`) codebase until you're ready.

#### See Branches
```bash
git branch
```
The asterisk `*` indicates the branch you are currently on (where HEAD is pointing).
```
* main
  new-feature
```

#### Create a Branch
```bash
# Create a new branch named 'new-feature'
git branch new-feature

# Switch to the 'new-feature' branch to start working on it
git checkout new-feature
```
Or, create and switch in one command:
```bash
# Create branch 'another-feature' and switch to it immediately
git checkout -b another-feature
```

#### Rename a Branch
```bash
# Rename 'old-name' to 'new-name' (make sure you're not currently on 'old-name')
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

#### Switch Branches
```bash
# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Switch to an existing feature branch
git checkout new-feature
```

#### Merge a Branch
Combines the changes from one branch into your *current* branch.

<Steps>
1.  **Switch to the receiving branch:** Usually `main`.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```
2.  **Merge the feature branch into main:**
    ```bash
    git merge new-feature
    ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="danger" title="Always Check Your Current Branch Before Merging!">
Make sure you are on the branch you want to merge *into* (like `main`) before running `git merge <feature-branch>`. Merging `main` *into* your feature branch is usually not what you want and can complicate your history.
</Aside>

### Conflicts (`git merge` conflicts)

A conflict happens when you try to merge branches that have changed the *same lines* in the *same file* differently. Git can't automatically decide which change is correct.

Git will mark the conflicted areas in the file like this:
```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Changes from your current branch (e.g., main)
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello from main branch!");
}
=======
// Changes from the branch you are merging (e.g., new-feature)
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello from the new feature!");
}
>>>>>>> new-feature
```

**To resolve:**
1.  Open the conflicted file(s) in your editor.
2.  Manually edit the file to remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and combine the changes the way you want them.
3.  Save the file.
4.  `git add <resolved-file-name>` the file(s) you fixed.
5.  `git commit` to finalize the merge commit.

### See Differences (`git diff`)

Shows the differences between various states in your repository (commits, branches, working directory, staging area).

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Show changes in your working directory NOT yet staged for commit
git diff

# Show changes that ARE staged for the next commit
git diff --staged > diff.md
# (or git diff --cached)

# Show differences between two branches
git diff main..new-feature

# Show differences for specific files between branches
git diff main..new-feature -- path/to/file1.js path/to/another/file.txt

# Show changes introduced between two specific commits
git diff <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>
```

#### Understanding Diff Output
```diff
diff --git a/file.js b/file.js
index abc123..def456 100644
--- a/file.js  <- The 'a' version (before changes)
+++ b/file.js  <- The 'b' version (after changes)
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ // Line numbers context: -line#,num_lines +line#,num_lines
 function greeting() {
-    console.log("Hello"); // Line starting with '-' was removed from 'a'
+    console.log("Hi");    // Line starting with '+' was added in 'b'
     console.log("Greeting completed"); // Unchanged line for context
 }

```

### Stashing Changes (`git stash`)

Temporarily saves your uncommitted local changes (both staged and unstaged) so you can switch branches or work on something else without committing incomplete work.

```bash
# Save current changes to the stash "stack"
git stash

# Save changes with a descriptive message
git stash save "WIP: Refactoring login form"

# See the list of stashed changes
git stash list
# Output might look like:
# stash@{0}: WIP on main: abc123d Initial commit
# stash@{1}: WIP: Refactoring login form

# Apply the most recent stash (stash@{0}) and keep it in the list
git stash apply

# Apply a specific stash (e.g., the second one in the list)
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Apply the most recent stash AND remove it from the stash list
git stash pop

# Remove a specific stash without applying it
git stash drop stash@{1}

# Remove ALL stashed changes (use with caution!)
git stash clear
```

#### Common Use Case: Switching Branches

<Aside type="tip" title="Stash Use Case: Clean Branch Switching">
Imagine you're working on `feature-branch` and have changes you aren't ready to commit, but you need to quickly switch to `main` to fix a bug.

```bash
# (On feature-branch with uncommitted changes)
git stash # Save your work temporarily
git checkout main # Switch branches cleanly

# ... fix the bug on main, commit, etc. ...

git checkout feature-branch # Switch back to your feature
git stash pop # Re-apply your saved changes and remove from stash
# Continue working on your feature!
```
</Aside>
```
