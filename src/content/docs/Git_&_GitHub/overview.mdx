## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.

### Why Git is needed:

- **Version history**: Maintains a complete history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously
- **Branching**: Supports creating separate branches for developing features without affecting the main codebase
- **Offline work**: Allows working locally without constant connection to a central server
- **Backup**: Serves as a backup system for your code and project files

### Install Git

Git is available on all major operating systems. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

```bash
git --version
```
#### Git Config

Before you start using Git, you need to configure your username and email address.So that Git knows who you are.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```


## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds a visual interface and additional features on top of Git's functionality.There are several other services that provide similar functionality to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

### GitHub Features:

- **Repository hosting**: Stores Git repositories in the cloud
- **Pull requests**: Facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes
- **Issues tracking**: Manages bugs, enhancements, and tasks
- **Project management**: Provides boards and tools to organize work
- **Actions**: Enables automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration tools**: Offers features like discussions, wikis, and team management

## Basic Git Commands

### Initialize a repository

```bash
git init
```
- This will create a new directory called `.git` in the current directory.
- This directory will contain the repository's metadata and history.

### Check the status of the repository

you should always check the status of the repository before you start working on it.

```bash
git status
```

### Add files to the repository

To track the changes you make to the files, you need to add them to the repository.

```bash
git add <file> // to add a specific file
git add . // to add all the files
```
### Commit changes

It is a checkpoint of the changes you have made to the files.

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Push changes to the repository

After committing your changes locally, you need to push them to the remote repository to make them available to others.

```bash
git push
```

### Git Log

To see the commit history, you can use the `git log` command.

```bash
git log --oneline // to see the commit history in one line
```
### Git Ignore

When you are working on a project, you may have files that you do not want to track with Git. For example, you may have a `node_modules` directory or API keys,Database credentials,etc.

You can create a `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```
example of a `.gitignore` file:

```
node_modules/
.env
```
### Git Branch

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas without affecting the main codebase.

```bash
git branch // to see the branches
```
The head pointer is the branch you are currently on.

```bash
* main
  feature-branch
```

#### Create a new branch

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

#### Switch to a branch

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

#### Merge a branch

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```
:::danger[Always Check Your Current Branch]
Always check which branch you are on before merging. You don't want to accidentally merge the main branch into your feature branch, which would require reverting changes to undo the damage.
:::

### Git Conflict

A conflict occurs when two branches have made changes to the same file and Git cannot automatically merge the changes.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
function hello() {
  return "Hello World";  // Current branch changes
}
=======
function hello() {
  return "Hi there";     // Incoming branch changes
}
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```
To resolve a conflict, you need to manually edit the file to combine the changes.
