Welcome to the repository for a comprehensive, personal knowledge base and digital garden built with modern web technologies. This project serves as a curated collection of high-quality documentation, notes, and guides on a wide range of topics in software development and computer science.

The primary goal of this site is to be a reliable, practical reference that avoids "tutorial hell" by focusing on foundational knowledge and actionable steps.

## About The Project

- **Core Computer Science**: Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Architecture
- **Programming Languages**: In-depth guides on C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Web Development**: Modern JavaScript, React, React Native, Electron.js, and CSS
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, Git & GitHub
- **Data Science**: Foundational Maths, Libraries (NumPy, Pandas), and Machine Learning concepts
